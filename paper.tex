\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Muon optimizer, a novel optimization technique, within the context of training a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Model. We conduct a series of three experiments to evaluate its performance against the widely-used AdamW optimizer. The experiments include a direct baseline comparison, an ablation study of Muon's core components (Momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization), and a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. Our findings indicate that the hybrid Muon optimizer slightly outperforms AdamW in final validation loss and accuracy, but incurs a minor computational overhead. The ablation study reveals that both momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization are critical for performance, with a strong synergistic effect. The hyperparameter analysis demonstrates that Muon is highly sensitive to the learning rate, with an optimal range between 0.02 and 0.05. This research provides empirical evidence for the viability of the Muon optimizer as a powerful alternative for training modern LLMs, offering insights into its operational characteristics and optimal configuration.

\section{Introduction}
The field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been dominated by optimizers from the Adam family, particularly AdamW \cite{loshchilov2017decoupled}. While effective, these methods can face challenges in stability and efficiency when scaling to increasingly large models. The Muon optimizer has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging matrix-aware techniques, specifically Newton-Schulz orthogonalization, to potentially offer a more stable and efficient training process \cite{bernstein2020metricizing}.

This paper investigates the practical performance of the Muon optimizer on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer-based LLM. We aim to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does a hybrid Muon optimizer compare to the standard AdamW optimizer in terms of performance and computational cost?
    \item What are the individual contributions of Muon's core components—momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization?
    \item How sensitive is the Muon optimizer to its key hyperparameters?
\end{itemize}

To address these questions, we conduct a series of controlled experiments on a consistent model architecture and dataset.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models}
MoE models utilize a sparse activation strategy where only a fraction of the model's parameters are used for any given input. This is achieved through a "router" network that directs input tokens to a subset of "expert" networks. This architecture allows for a significant increase in model capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost per forward pass, making it an efficient choice for large-scale models.

\subsection{The Muon Optimizer}
The Muon optimizer, short for MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-schulz, operates on entire matrices of parameters. Its key innovation is the use of the Newton-Schulz iteration to efficiently compute the orthogonalization of the gradient matrix. This process helps to maintain gradient stability and encourages a more uniform learning process across the network's layers. In our experiments, we employ a hybrid strategy where Muon is applied to the 2D weight matrices of the model, while AdamW is used for other parameters like embeddings and normalization layers.

The core update step involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Applying momentum to the gradient.
    \item Orthogonalizing the resulting gradient using the \texttt{zeropower\_via\_newtonschulz5} function.
    \item Applying the final update to the parameter weights.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Setup}
All experiments were conducted using a consistent setup to ensure comparability of results.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Architecture}: A 6-layer MoE Transformer with a model dimension of 384, 8 attention heads, and a feed-forward dimension of 1536. The model included 8 experts, with a top-2 routing strategy.
    \item \textbf{Dataset}: A 500,000 token subset of the SmolLM corpus.
    \item \textbf{Training}: All models were trained for 1000 steps with a batch size of 24 and 4 gradient accumulation steps.
    \item \textbf{Hardware}: All experiments were run on a single NVIDIA GPU.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Experiment 1: Baseline Comparison (Muon vs. AdamW)}
This experiment compared the performance of the hybrid Muon optimizer against a pure AdamW optimizer.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Experiment 1: Muon vs. AdamW Performance.}
\label{tab:exp1}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Metric & Muon & AdamW & Difference \\ \midrule
Validation Loss & \textbf{0.0476} & 0.0547 & -0.0072 \\
Validation Accuracy & \textbf{0.9907} & 0.9881 & +0.0026 \\
Validation Perplexity & \textbf{1.05} & 1.06 & -0.01 \\
Training Time (min) & 13.3 & \textbf{11.8} & +1.5 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results in Table \ref{tab:exp1} show that the Muon optimizer achieved a slightly better validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity. However, this came at the cost of a 12.7\% increase in training time compared to AdamW.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Ablation Study}
This experiment analyzed the contribution of Muon's two main components: momentum and Newton-Schulz (NS) orthogonalization.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Experiment 2: Ablation Study Results.}
\label{tab:exp2}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Variant & Val Loss & Val Acc & Val PPL & Time (min) \\ \midrule
Full Muon (Momentum + NS) & \textbf{2.5347} & \textbf{0.4948} & \textbf{12.61} & 2.7 \\
Momentum Only (No NS) & 5.4336 & 0.1385 & 228.98 & \textbf{2.4} \\
NS Only (No Momentum) & 3.8273 & 0.2926 & 45.94 & 2.7 \\
Basic SGD-like (No Both) & 5.2608 & 0.1628 & 192.63 & \textbf{2.4} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The ablation study (Table \ref{tab:exp2}) clearly demonstrates that both components are crucial. Removing either one led to a significant degradation in performance. The analysis indicated a strong, positive synergy effect of 1.4654, suggesting the components are more effective together than the sum of their individual contributions. Momentum appears to be the more critical component, as its removal resulted in a larger performance drop than the removal of Newton-Schulz.

\subsection{Experiment 3: Hyperparameter Sensitivity}
This experiment tested Muon's sensitivity to learning rate, momentum, and the number of Newton-Schulz steps.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Experiment 3: Optimal Hyperparameters.}
\label{tab:exp3}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
Hyperparameter & Optimal Value (based on Val Loss) \\ \midrule
Learning Rate & 0.05 (Loss: 0.3277) \\
Momentum & 0.95 (Loss: 2.5296) \\
Newton-Schulz Steps & 7 (Loss: 2.4955) \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The optimizer showed the highest sensitivity to the \textbf{learning rate}, with performance improving by 18.6x from the worst to the best-tested value. A higher learning rate of 0.05 was found to be optimal. The model was moderately sensitive to \textbf{momentum}, with 0.95 being the optimal value and 0.99 leading to degraded performance. Sensitivity to the number of \textbf{Newton-Schulz steps} was the weakest, with 7 steps performing best, but showing diminishing returns compared to 5 steps.


\section{Discussion}
Our results suggest that the hybrid Muon optimizer is a viable and competitive alternative to AdamW for training MoE LLMs. The slight performance edge observed in Experiment 1 indicates its potential, though the increased training time is a trade-off to consider.

The ablation study highlights the sophisticated design of Muon; it is not merely a combination of existing techniques but a synergistic system where momentum and orthogonalization work in concert. This is a critical insight for future optimizer design.

The hyperparameter analysis provides a practical guide for tuning Muon. The extreme sensitivity to learning rate, far more than to its other parameters, suggests that practitioners should prioritize tuning the learning rate when adopting this optimizer. The optimal rate of 0.05 is significantly higher than typical default learning rates for AdamW, highlighting a key difference in their operational characteristics.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we conducted a systematic analysis of the Muon optimizer on a Mixture-of-Experts LLM. We found that Muon offers a slight performance advantage over AdamW at the cost of increased training time. Its core components, momentum and Newton-Schulz orthogonalization, are both critical and synergistic. The optimizer is highly sensitive to learning rate, and we identified an optimal range for this hyperparameter.

Future work should involve testing on larger models and datasets to verify if these findings scale. Furthermore, a more in-depth analysis of the computational overhead with more robust profiling tools could help pinpoint optimization opportunities within the Newton-Schulz iteration itself.
