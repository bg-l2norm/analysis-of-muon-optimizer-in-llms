# Experiment 1: Muon vs AdamW Baseline Comparison - Results

## Summary
Initial results show **dramatic improvements** with Muon optimizer over AdamW baseline.

## Configuration
- **Model**: MoE Transformer (384d, 6L, 8H, 1536ff)
- **Training**: 1000 steps, batch size 24, gradient accumulation 4
- **Data**: 500K tokens from SmolLM corpus
- **Optimizers**: Muon (hybrid) vs AdamW (pure)

## Results

| Metric | Muon | AdamW | Improvement |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Validation Loss** | 2.5371 | 5.0520 | **50% better** |
| **Validation Accuracy** | 49.37% | 20.89% | **2.4x better** |
| **Validation Perplexity** | 12.64 | 156.33 | **12x better** |
| **Training Time** | 2.8 min | 2.3 min | +0.5 min |

## Key Observations

### üéØ **Performance**
- Muon achieves **much better convergence** in same training time
- Validation loss difference is **substantial** (-2.51)
- Accuracy improvement is **dramatic** (+28.5 percentage points)

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Efficiency** 
- Only **21% longer training time** for much better results
- Cost-benefit ratio is **excellent** (0.5 min extra for massive gains)

### üìä **Convergence Quality**
- Muon: 12.64 perplexity (excellent for language modeling)
- AdamW: 156.33 perplexity (poor convergence)

## Concerns & Next Steps

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues**
1. **Limited training steps** (1000) - models may not be fully converged
2. **Small dataset** (500K tokens) - results may not generalize
3. **Single run** - need multiple seeds for statistical significance

### üîÑ **Recommended Actions**
1. **Increase training steps** to 5000-10000 for better convergence
2. **Run remaining experiments** (ablation, hyperparams, profiling)
3. **Multiple random seeds** for statistical validation
4. **Larger dataset** for more robust conclusions

## Conclusion
**Initial results are extremely promising** - Muon shows dramatic improvements over AdamW with minimal computational overhead. However, these results need validation with longer training and larger datasets.
